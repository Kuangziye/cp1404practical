# Practical 07
# This README file is used to record my thinking when I am doing CP1404 Prac 7 work
In this  lessons studying I have studied these three things about clean code:
1. How to give class a sample name like function follow PEP8 naming recommendations.
2. How to use "EAFP" to double-check the code.
3. Use the relevant code to define the class like(__init__,__str__)
