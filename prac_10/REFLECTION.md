1. regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?

    >A:I think my accuracy in my estimation of the actual task is lacking. In many cases I always underestimate the difficulty of the tasks even though I have thoughts to guide me step by step through the projects. I think my accuracy is improving as I take this course. Because I made repeated mistakes throughout the course, I took the time to check for these mistakes later on in the project.

2. regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?

   >A: Regarding the "code review", I've learnt that often the process of helping others find code errors is also the process of helping myself organise my thoughts on writing code. When I read code along the lines of others I can see many ways to optimise my own code.

3. regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

   >A: If I were in charge of the practical tasks overall, I should be designing more step-by-step iterative topics (e.g., writing frameworks and then adding features) and fewer relatively stand-alone topics.
